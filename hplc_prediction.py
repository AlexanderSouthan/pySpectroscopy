            of the n components as lists, so contains n lists in the same order

            lists therefore contains as many items as in spectrum_wavelengths.
        wavelengths : ndarray, optional
            Wavelengths used for calculating the absorption spectra. The
            default is np.linspace(200, 400, 201).
        times : ndarray, optional
            Time values used for calculation of the elugrams. The default is

        noise_level : float, optional
            Data is superimposed with Gaussian noise if noise_level != 0. The
